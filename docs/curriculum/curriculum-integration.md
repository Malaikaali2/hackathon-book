# Curriculum Integration: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive view of how all components of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course integrate to create a cohesive and effective learning experience. It demonstrates the interconnectedness of knowledge outcomes, skill outcomes, competency outcomes, and assessment methods, showing how each element reinforces and supports the others to achieve the course's overarching goals.

## Integration Framework

### The Integration Triangle

```
                    Knowledge Outcomes
                          /\
                         /  \
                        /    \
                       /      \
                      /        \
        Skill Outcomes ---------- Competency Outcomes
```

The curriculum integration operates on the principle that knowledge, skills, and competencies are mutually reinforcing:
