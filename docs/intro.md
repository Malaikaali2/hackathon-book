# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This book provides comprehensive coverage of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, emphasizing the intersection of artificial intelligence and embodied systems (Siciliano & Khatib, 2016). The book explores the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of intelligent robots that interact with the physical world, covering essential topics from robotic operating systems to vision-language-action models (Russell & Norvig, 2020).

## Target Audience

This book is designed for graduate students, researchers, and software engineers interested in the rapidly evolving field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Readers are expected to have foundational knowledge of programming, linear algebra, and basic machine learning concepts (Corke, 2017).

## Structure

The content is organized into four core modules:
- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Plus a comprehensive capstone project: "The Autonomous Humanoid"

## Academic Standards

This book adheres to strict academic standards:
- ≥50% peer-reviewed sources (Mur-Arti & Tardós, 2017)
- APA citation format
- Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10-12
- Word count: 5,000-7,000 (excluding references)
- Zero plagiarism tolerance

## How to Use This Book

Each module builds upon the previous, with ROS 2 concepts foundational for all subsequent modules (Quigley et al., 2009). Simulation concepts (Module 2) inform real-world implementation strategies, and AI concepts (Modules 3-4) integrate with control systems (Module 1). The capstone project synthesizes all concepts into a complete autonomous humanoid system.

### Hands-on Learning

Each module includes practical labs and exercises that allow readers to apply theoretical concepts to real implementations. The progression moves from basic (middleware) to advanced (AI) concepts, with simulation before real-world implementation for safety and cost considerations (Tedrake, 2023).
