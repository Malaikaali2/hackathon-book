# Capstone Evaluation Rubric: Autonomous Humanoid System

## Overview

The Capstone Evaluation Rubric provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the implementation and performance of the autonomous humanoid system. This rubric evaluates the integration of all capstone components including voice processing, task planning, navigation, manipulation, perception, and failure handling. The evaluation framework uses multiple assessment dimensions to ensure thorough evaluation of both technical implementation and practical functionality, with clear criteria for different performance levels.

The rubric is designed to assess not only the individual components but also their integration and coordination, reflecting the complex, multi-faceted nature of autonomous humanoid systems. This evaluation framework ensures that students demonstrate mastery of the complete system lifecycle from design to deployment and validation.

## Evaluation Framework

### Assessment Dimensions

The capstone evaluation encompasses five primary dimensions:

1. **Technical Implementation (30%)**: Quality of code, architecture, and technical solution
2. **System Integration (25%)**: Coordination and communication between components
