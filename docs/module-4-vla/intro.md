# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement systems that connect language understanding to physical robot actions
- Deploy multimodal AI models that combine visual, linguistic, and motor capabilities
- Evaluate multimodal systems for robotic applications
- Create voice command interpretation systems

## Overview

This module covers advanced multimodal AI systems that combine visual, linguistic, and motor capabilities for complex robotic tasks. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand natural language commands and execute corresponding physical behaviors.

### Key Concepts
- Multimodal embeddings and representations
- Instruction following and task planning
- Embodied language models
- Action grounding and execution
- Natural language to robot action mapping

### Skills Gained
- Implementing VLA models
- Connecting language understanding to robot actions
- Evaluating multimodal systems
- Creating voice command interpretation systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Understanding of Modules 1-3 concepts
- Familiarity with transformer models and NLP (helpful but not required)
- Basic understanding of robotic control systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized as follows:
1. Multimodal embeddings and representations
2. Instruction following and task planning
3. Embodied language models implementation
4. Action grounding and execution
5. Voice command interpretation system
6. Natural language to robot action mapping
7. VLA system integration lab
