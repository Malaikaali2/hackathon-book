# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and basic concepts
- Create and deploy a basic ROS 2 package with multiple nodes communicating over topics
- Implement complex robot behaviors using ROS 2
- Integrate multiple subsystems using ROS 2

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware framework that enables communication between different components of robotic systems (Quigley et al., 2009). ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of a robot, coordinating the flow of information between sensors, actuators, and processing units (Oakley et al., 2017).

### Key Concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, actions
- Packages, launch files, parameter server
- TF transforms
- DDS (Data Distribution Service) communication

### Skills Gained
- Creating ROS 2 packages
- Implementing publishers/subscribers
- Debugging distributed systems
- Managing robot state

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python or C++
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Familiarity with command line interfaces

## Module Structure

This module is organized as follows:
1. ROS 2 fundamentals and architecture
2. Working with nodes and topics
3. Services and actions
4. Packages and launch files
5. Parameter management
6. TF transforms and coordinate frames
7. Navigation stack integration
8. Sensor fusion implementation
9. Verification and debugging
