## Prompt

Complete implementation of User Story 1: Academic Learner Building Foundation for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project. This includes all content for Modules 1-2 with proper academic standards, citations, and validation.

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed all tasks for User Story 1 (Academic Learner Building Foundation) in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project. All 20 tasks (T015-T034) have been implemented across Modules 1-2:

Module 1 (The Robotic Nervous System - ROS 2):
- T015-T022: Complete content for ROS 2 fundamentals, advanced topics, hands-on labs, and verification

Module 2 (The Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity):
- T023-T030: Complete content for simulation environments, sensor modeling, Unity integration, sim-to-reality transfer, and hands-on labs

Source Verification:
- T031-T034: Research, citation, verification, and peer-review validation completed with ≥50% peer-reviewed sources

All content meets academic standards with proper APA citations, Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10-12, 5000-7000 word count compliance, and zero plagiarism tolerance. The implementation follows the technical plan and satisfies all constitution requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User Story 1 fully implemented with all Modules 1-2 content completed
- 🧪 Tests: All academic standards validated (≥50% peer-reviewed sources, APA citations, readability)
- 📁 Files: 15+ content files, 2 validation scripts, and reference materials created/updated
- 🔁 Next: Ready to proceed with User Story 2 (Practitioner Transitioning to Physical AI)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied Spec-Kit Plus methodology to create academically rigorous robotics content

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All academic validation checks passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of User Story 2 tasks
