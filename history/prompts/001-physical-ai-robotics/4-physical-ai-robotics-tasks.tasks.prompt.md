## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project. The tasks.md file includes 108 specific, actionable tasks organized across 9 phases: Setup (T001-T007), Foundational (T008-T014), User Story 1 - Academic Learner (T015-T034), User Story 2 - Practitioner (T035-T056), User Story 3 - Educator (T057-T069), Capstone Project (T070-T078), Hardware Specifications (T079-T088), References & Validation (T089-T097), and Polish (T098-T108). All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) and include dependencies, parallel execution examples, and independent test criteria for each user story.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project
- 🧪 Tests: All tasks follow required checklist format with proper structure
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md in feature directory with 108 actionable tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation following the task sequence
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All tasks follow required format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks
